### Hey, I'm Jacob (:

I'm a student + TA at the University of British Columbia who loves constantly learning and wearing many different hats. And scarves. At my current internship, I'm formally verifying an SoC and have also interned as a full-stack web developer.

Nothing beats a fun problem; here's one I came across (and got very wrong) while on exchange in Chile:
>We're playing Secret Santa and the number of people we're playing with trends to infinity (we're popular). What are the odds that at least one person picks their own name out of the hat?
